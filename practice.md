**Basic**

1. **Sign of a Number:** Write a function that takes a number as input and returns "Positive", "Negative", or "Zero" depending on its value.
2. **Smallest of Three:** Write a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the smallest of the three.
3. **Vowel or Consonant:** Write a function that takes a character as input and determines if it's a vowel or consonant.
4. **Alarm Clock:** Write a function that takes the current time and a target alarm time as input, and determines if the alarm should be ringing.
5. **Movie Ticket Price:** Write a function that calculates the price of a movie ticket based on age (child, adult, senior) and time of day (matinee, evening).

**Intermediate**

1. **Sorting Three Numbers:** Write a function that takes three numbers as input and prints them in ascending order.
2. **Guessing Game:** Create a simple number guessing game where the computer generates a random number and the user has to guess it.
3. **Change Calculator:** Write a function that takes an amount of money and calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make that amount.
4. **Caesar Cipher:** Implement a Caesar cipher, which shifts each letter in a string by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.
5. **Palindrome Number:** Write a function that checks if a number is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

**Advanced**

1. **Days in a Month:** Write a function that takes a month (represented as a number or string) and a year, and returns the number of days in that month.
2. **Collatz Conjecture:** Write a function that takes a positive integer and applies the Collatz conjecture: If the number is even, divide it by 2. If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat this process until the number reaches 1.
3. **Barcode Validator:** Write a function that validates a barcode using a specific check digit algorithm.
4. **Leap Year with Julian Calendar:** Write a function that determines if a year is a leap year, taking into account the rules of both the Gregorian and Julian calendars.
5. **Simple Calculator:** Create a simple calculator program that can perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, \*, /).

**Expert**

1. **Recursive Maze Solver:** Write a function that uses recursion to solve a maze represented as a 2D array.
2. **Knight's Tour:** Write a function that finds a Knight's tour on a chessboard, where the knight visits every square exactly once.
3. **Cellular Automata:** Implement a simple cellular automaton like Conway's Game of Life, where the state of each cell in a grid evolves based on its neighbors.
4. **Text-Based Adventure Game:** Create a text-based adventure game where the player makes choices that affect the story and outcome.
5. **Brainfuck Interpreter:** Implement an interpreter for the Brainfuck esoteric programming language, which relies heavily on conditional logic.
